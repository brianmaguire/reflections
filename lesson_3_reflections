When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
1. when I'm working on the project in multiple locations from different computers
2. for security - as a backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

1. to allow you to decide how when you commit, avoiding excessive small commits
2. You may be working on a machine where you don't want to locally store your repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks: copies of a repository, usually another persons, though I guess you could fork your own.  It is basically a clone created on GitHub.

Clone: a copy of a repository with links to the original that you can push/pull with.  The original is called a remote and the default name is "origin"

Branch: a branch is an alternative development path within one repository.  It is a 'branch' off the master and can be merged into the master.
