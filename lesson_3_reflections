When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
1. when I'm working on the project in multiple locations from different computers
2. for security - as a backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

1. to allow you to decide how when you commit, avoiding excessive small commits
2. You may be working on a machine where you don't want to locally store your repository.
