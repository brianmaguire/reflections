What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You create the framework that makes tracking changes in files possible (to track them you add files in that directiory to the currently empty repositor.  
You need it if you want to track files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory contains the repository of tracked files plus untracked files (ones you don't want to pay that much attention to).  The staging area provides a temporary area where you can set up your commits and change them if necessary before they actually change logs and other Git features.
