What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You create the framework that makes tracking changes in files possible (to track them you add files in that directiory to the currently empty repositor.  
You need it if you want to track files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory contains the repository of tracked files plus untracked files (ones you don't want to pay that much attention to).  The staging area provides a temporary area where you can set up your commits and change them if necessary before they actually change logs and other Git features.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

The staging area allows you to compare what you are about to commit to what is already committed. This means you can see the scope of the changes you are about to make and if necessary split them into 2 or more commits.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

When using a template as the basis of a program, especialy if it's a family of programs.  You could branch off the template and not risk damaging it.  

For documentation, if you have to prepare different versions for different audiences.
